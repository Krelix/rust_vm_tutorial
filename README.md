### Iridium VM (redux)

This repository is the code written by following along [this tutorial series on building a language VM](https://blog.subnetzero.io/post/building-language-vm-part-00/)

### How to use

```sh
cargo run
```

This will download dependencies, build and run the REPL for this fledgling VM. The REPL only support 2 commands `.history` and `.quit`, all other commands will fail for now.
